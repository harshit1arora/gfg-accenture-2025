E-commerce platforms struggle with: Generic recommendations ("Customers also bought") that ignore individual preferences. Manual segmentation of users (e.g., "women aged 20-30") leading to irrelevant suggestions. Low conversion rates due to impersonalized browsing experiences. To solve these problems we have created SmartCart. Code will be uploaded post submission. Currently under final testing. Please refer to demo video/PPT for walkthrough.

**A machine learning solution to reduce $300B/year lost due to poor product suggestions**

## 📌 Problem Statement
- **Generic recommendations**: Showing "running shoes" after purchase
- **Slow personalization**: Manual segmentation can't adapt in real-time
- **High costs**: Teams waste 200+ hours/month on manual tagging
## ✨ Solution
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Irrelevant suggestions | ✅ Real-time personalization |
| ❌ 68% abandonment | ✅ 40% lower bounce rate |
| ❌ Manual tagging | ✅ Auto-categorization using NLP |
