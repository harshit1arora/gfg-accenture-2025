E-commerce platforms struggle with: Generic recommendations ("Customers also bought") that ignore individual preferences. Manual segmentation of users (e.g., "women aged 20-30") leading to irrelevant suggestions. Low conversion rates due to impersonalized browsing experiences. To solve these problems we have created SmartCart.

# 🔍 Smart E-Commerce Recommendations

**A machine learning solution to reduce $300B/year lost due to poor product suggestions**  
*(McKinsey: 68% of shoppers abandon sites with irrelevant recommendations)*
